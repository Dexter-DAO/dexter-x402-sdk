# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.5] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **`wrapFetch` + `createEvmKeypairWallet` ESM compatibility** — v1.6.4 used `require('viem/accounts')` which fails in ESM consumers because viem 2.x is ESM-only. Replaced with `await import('viem/accounts')` (dynamic import). `createEvmKeypairWallet` is now async; `wrapFetch` starts the import eagerly and awaits it before the first fetch call, keeping its own signature synchronous.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **`wrapFetch` EVM support** — `evmPrivateKey` option now works. Previously, passing an EVM private key to `wrapFetch` would log a warning and silently discard the key, causing all Base/EVM payments to fail with `no_matching_payment_option`. The key is now used to create a proper EVM wallet via viem's `privateKeyToAccount` (chain-agnostic EIP-712 signing).

### Added
- **`createEvmKeypairWallet()`** — New helper (parallel to `createKeypairWallet` for Solana) that creates an `EvmWallet` from a hex private key. Exported from `@dexterai/x402/client`. Useful for Node.js scripts that need EVM payments without a browser wallet.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Access Pass** — New payment pattern: pay once, get a time-limited JWT for unlimited API requests. Works with both SVM and EVM.
  - **Server**: `x402AccessPass` middleware (`@dexterai/x402/server`) — drop-in Express middleware with tier-based and custom duration pricing. Issues JWTs after x402 payment settlement. Validates passes on subsequent requests without touching the facilitator.
  - **Client**: `accessPass` option on `wrapFetch` and `createX402Client` (`@dexterai/x402/client`) — auto-detects servers that offer access passes, purchases one, caches the JWT, and includes it on all subsequent requests. Auto-renews expired passes.
  - **React**: `useAccessPass` hook (`@dexterai/x402/react`) — dedicated hook for managing the access pass lifecycle: tier discovery, pass purchase, token caching, countdown timer, and auto-fetch with pass.
- New types: `AccessPassTier`, `AccessPassInfo`, `AccessPassClaims`, `AccessPassClientConfig`
- New error codes: `access_pass_expired`, `access_pass_invalid`, `access_pass_tier_not_found`, `access_pass_exceeds_max_spend`
- New HTTP headers: `X-ACCESS-PASS-TIERS` (server -> client on 402), `ACCESS-PASS` (server -> client on pass purchase)
- `test/access-pass.ts` — 8-assertion test suite covering the full access pass lifecycle

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **PAYMENT-RESPONSE header** — Server middleware now sets `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header (base64-encoded settlement data) on 200 OK responses after successful payment, per the x402 v2 HTTP transport spec. Previously, settlement data was only attached to `req.x402` but not surfaced as a response header.
- **`amount` field in 402 response** — The `accepts` array in payment requirements now includes both `amount` (v2 spec field) and `maxAmountRequired` (legacy field). Non-Dexter v2 clients that look for `amount` instead of `maxAmountRequired` will now find it.
- **`x402Version` in facilitator requests** — The `FacilitatorClient` now sends `x402Version: 2` at the top level of `/verify` and `/settle` request bodies, matching the Coinbase reference implementation format.

### Added
- `test/v2-spec-compliance.ts` — Automated test suite validating all three v2 spec compliance fixes against a mock facilitator (6 assertions).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Model Registry** - Comprehensive single source of truth for all OpenAI models (`model-registry.ts`)
  - 25 models across 5 tiers: fast, standard, reasoning, premium, specialized

  - Reasoning models: o1, o1-mini, o1-pro, o3, o3-mini, o3-pro, o4-mini
  - Specialized: deep-research, computer-use-preview, realtime models
- **Registry API**:
  - `MODEL_REGISTRY` - Full model definitions with pricing, capabilities, and API parameters
  - `getModel(id)` - Get model by ID (throws if not found)
  - `findModel(id)` - Get model by ID (returns undefined if not found)
  - `getModelsByTier(tier)` - Get all models in a tier
  - `getModelsByFamily(family)` - Get models by family (gpt-5, o3, etc.)

  - `supportsTemperature` - GPT-5 models only support default (1)
  - `supportsReasoningEffort` - For o-series models
  - `supportsTools`, `supportsStructuredOutput`, `supportsStreaming`

### Changed
- `token-pricing.ts` now uses `MODEL_REGISTRY` as its data source (no more duplicate pricing)
- `getAvailableModels()` returns models sorted by tier then price

### Developer Tools
- **Model Evaluation Harness** (`test/model-eval/`) - CLI for testing models

- Internal refactoring for model pricing

## [1.2.4] - 2024-12-30

### Fixed
- **x402 v1 compatibility** - SDK now echoes the `x402Version` from the server's 402 response instead of hardcoding v2. This enables compatibility with v1-only facilitators (PayAI, Ultraviolet, etc.)
- Added `x402Version` field to `PaymentAccept` type

## [1.2.1] - 2024-12-28

### Added
- **Custom model support** for `createTokenPricing()`:
  - `inputRate` - Custom USD per 1M input tokens (for Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, etc.)
  - `outputRate` - Custom USD per 1M output tokens
  - `maxTokens` - Custom max output tokens
  - `tokenizer` - Custom tokenizer function for non-OpenAI models
- `'custom'` tier for user-defined pricing

### Changed
- `createDynamicPricing()` documentation clarified: works for ANY pricing scenario, not just LLM
- README now shows examples for Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and local models

## [1.2.0] - 2024-12-28

### Added
- **Token Pricing** - `createTokenPricing()` for accurate LLM pricing using tiktoken
- Uses real OpenAI model rates (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, o1, o3, etc.)

- `countTokens()` - Accurate token counting using OpenAI's tiktoken
- `getAvailableModels()` - List all models sorted by tier and price
- `isValidModel()` - Check if a model is supported
- `formatTokenPricing()` - Display helper (e.g., "$0.15 per 1M tokens")

### Changed
- Dynamic pricing now has two variants:
  - `createDynamicPricing()` - Character-based (generic, no deps)
  - `createTokenPricing()` - Token-based (LLM-accurate, uses tiktoken)

## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-27

### Added
- **Dynamic Pricing** - `createDynamicPricing()` for LLM/AI endpoints where cost scales with input
- Quote hash validation prevents prompt manipulation (includes pricing config in hash)
- `formatPricing()` helper for display strings
- Client SDK now forwards `X-Quote-Hash` header on retry

## [1.0.4] - 2024-12-27

### Changed
- **README overhaul** - Professional documentation with live demo links, emoji formatting, and clear API reference
- Prominent link to [dexter.cash/sdk](https://dexter.cash/sdk) for live verification

- Users now see a clear, actionable error message before wallet popup appears

## [1.0.1] - 2024-12-26

### Fixed
- EVM adapter payload structure now correctly separates `authorization` and `signature` fields to match upstream `@x402/evm` format
- Removed unnecessary `feePayer` validation for EVM networks (users pay their own gas)

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-26

### Added
- **Chain-agnostic architecture** - Support for multiple blockchains through adapter pattern
- **SolanaAdapter** - Full Solana mainnet/devnet support with sponsored fees

- Solana: Sponsored fees via ComputeBudget instructions (12k CU limit, 1 microlamport priority)
- EVM: EIP-3009 TransferWithAuthorization for gasless token transfers
- v2 protocol only (header-based flow with `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` / `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`)

## Migration from PayAI SDKs

If migrating from `@payai/x402-solana`:

```diff
- import { createX402Client } from '@payai/x402-solana';
+ import { createX402Client } from '@dexterai/x402/client';
+ import { createSolanaAdapter } from '@dexterai/x402/adapters';

- const client = createX402Client({ wallet });
+ const client = createX402Client({
+   adapters: [createSolanaAdapter()],
+   wallets: { solana: wallet },
+ });
```

Key differences:
- Dexter SDK is v2-only (no legacy X-PAYMENT header support)
- Multi-chain by design - add Base support by including `createEvmAdapter()`
- Phantom-compatible (handles Lighthouse assertions automatically)
